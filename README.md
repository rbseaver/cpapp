# CPApp

## Overview

This is my modest attempt to create a web-based interface for reviewing CPApp machine data. There is currently
an excellent product already out there called SleepHQ. It is robust, and has a very well-designed interface.
However, for some of the advanced features, you need to pay a monthly subscription fee, which I can't afford right now.

My goal here is to build something that can be used for free,
while exposing some of the "advanced" features of SleepHQ for free.
Hopefully, I can add something unique, too.

## Supported Devices
Since this is a personal project, I'll start with support for the device I own, which is the ResMed AirSense 11.
